        <h1>Reflection | Life Update</h1>
        <p>Looking back at the past few months, I haven't had the luxury of reflecting.</p>
<p>I usually stop by and look at where I am headed in life. What am I trying to do? What did I do wrong? These questions often lead to hours of monologue with myself and my journal.</p>
<p>These are less career-oriented. Strange to put it this way, but not all reflection, self-growth and pondering have to be career-related. There's more to life than just a job that turns me into a cog and wears me down -till I'm 60.</p>
<p>I need more from life; I need more from myself. These reflections have led to knowledge, or dare I say, wisdom. I've learnt many things from myself; tweaking my actions, habits, words and the content I consume to suit my values and interests.</p>
<p>There's only so much you can read (in self-help). But it's harder to apply in practice. Even though we may try to use it, it generally ends up around one goal - the work you do.</p>
<p>I hate to see it that way. Although, your craft is simply who you can be. But as a person, solely your work is not enough.</p>
<p>I want to foster the values I've learnt, the lessons I've picked up, and the morals we read as kids simply, to live.</p>
<p>I want a life of simplicity. That is not just defined by the work I do - as a job. But I want to learn about myself. Who am I? What am I?</p>
<p>The more I journal, the more I write about myself, the more I end up discovering.</p>
<p>On a side note, probably don't write with a pencil, some memories may get muddy. It's okay though, it's fine to miss out on some things. We don't need to be forever informed.</p>
<p>Thus this life update, I may have missed out on writing for a few months - I've been caught up with studies, college, internship and trying to get a job.</p>
<p>There is a havoc in my brain, and hey, maybe it's not a big thing for you but it's been dragging me around for a while now.</p>
<p>In the end, one should take breaks, to look back, to trace their journey - to see who they were and who they can be.
And a tiny reminder to self, to reflect more often.</p>
