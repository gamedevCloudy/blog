            <title>Reflection | Life Update</title>

            <description>Balancing carrer and personal growth</description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looking back at the past few months, I haven't had the luxury of reflecting.</p>
<p>I usually stop by and look at where I am headed in life. What am I trying to do? What did I do wrong? These questions often lead to hours of monologue with myself and my journal.</p>
<p>These are less career-oriented. Strange to put it this way, but not all reflection, self-growth and pondering have to be career-related. There's more to life than just a job that turns me into a cog and wears me down -till I'm 60.</p>
<p>I need more from life; I need more from myself. These reflections have led to knowledge, or dare I say, wisdom. I've learnt many things from myself; tweaking my actions, habits, words and the content I consume to suit my values and interests.</p>
<p>There's only so much you can read (in self-help). But it's harder to apply in practice. Even though we may try to use it, it generally ends up around one goal - the work you do.</p>
<p>I hate to see it that way. Although, your craft is simply who you can be. But as a person, solely your work is not enough.</p>
<p>I want to foster the values I've learnt, the lessons I've picked up, and the morals we read as kids simply, to live.</p>
<p>I want a life of simplicity. That is not just defined by the work I do - as a job. But I want to learn about myself. Who am I? What am I?</p>
<p>The more I journal, the more I write about myself, the more I end up discovering.</p>
<p>On a side note, probably don't write with a pencil, some memories may get muddy. It's okay though, it's fine to miss out on some things. We don't need to be forever informed.</p>
<p>Thus this life update, I may have missed out on writing for a few months - I've been caught up with studies, college, internship and trying to get a job.</p>
<p>There is a havoc in my brain, and hey, maybe it's not a big thing for you but it's been dragging me around for a while now.</p>
<p>In the end, one should take breaks, to look back, to trace their journey - to see who they were and who they can be.
And a tiny reminder to self, to reflect more often.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One should buy a budget camera + a cheaper phone than a flagship phone.</p>
<p>MKBHD says, <a href="https://x.com/MKBHD/status/1656345593143508993">"What is a photo?"</a>. We've come so far in computational photography that computed photos are indistinguishable from real ones.
I recently tried Google's 'Add Me', and it's really believable.</p>
<p>In general, I do not like the ease of photos. How we feel every moment needs to be captured and why we need only the top x phone to get the best moments possible.</p>
<p>We should be more in the moment. How we're glued to our phones is sad.
These <code>snaps</code> end up being forgotten. And you lost the touch you could have had with the moment.
Somehow, we have trained our brains to enjoy 'shareable moments' more than whatever hits our neurons naturally.</p>
<p>It's become a game: send more snaps and be rewarded in the online circle. We don't meet more 'real' people. We don't share a physical bond.</p>
<p>We should be sharing whatever we experience with whoever was present when taking the snap. Simply, not taking the snap.</p>
<p>It's fine when you're alone and find something too cute/fun to not share with one person.</p>
<p>But next time you pull your phone out to take a pic, maybe smile at what you saw and put it back in.</p>
